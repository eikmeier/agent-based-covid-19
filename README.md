## Codebase Notes 

To run this code: Run **main.py** and follow the prompts given in the console to set some important parameters of the experiment.<br>
<ol>
<li> Plots will be created and stored in an images folder in the current directory. Additionally, all four plots will show on the screen upon running the program. </li>
<li> Lastly, data for the four plots will be stored in the data folder in the current directory.</li>
<li> The time to run one simulation varies widely based on computer, but it has been seen to vary anywhere between six seconds to a minute, so be forewarned before running the program.</li>
<ol> <li> When a simulation finishes, "Simulation finished.", will be printed in the console. </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <br>
Constants that are used in all other files in the code are stored in <b> global_constants.py </b> <br>
Attributes and methods solely relating to agents are stored in <b> covid_agents.py </b> <br>
Attributes and methods solely relating to spaces and subspaces are stored in <b> spaces.py </b> <br>
Details and information about the scheduling process of agents to spaces are stored in <b> schedule.py </b> <br> </br>

## Documentation Notes

Documentation is located in the <b> documentation </b> folder. Currently, just the COVID Summer 2021 MAP Write-up is located in there. This PDF explains the design decisions and basic structure of the codebase.
