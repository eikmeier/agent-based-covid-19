To run this code: Run **main.py** and follow the prompts given in the console to set some important parameters of the experiment.
 Plots will be created and stored in an images folder in the current directory. Additionally, all four plots will show on the screen upon running the program.
 Lastly, data for the four plots will be stored in the data folder in the current directory.
 The time to run one simulation varies widely based on computer, but it has been seen to vary anywhere between 6 seconds to a minute, so be forewarned before running the program.
  When a simulation finishes, "Simulation finished.", will be printed in the console.
Constants that are used in all other files in the code are stored in **global_constants.py**
Attributes and methods solely relating to agents are stored in **covid_agents.py**
Attributes and methods solely relating to spaces and subspaces are stored in **spaces.py**
Details and information about the scheduling process of agents to spaces are stored in **schedule.py**

*This code was largely written by Erik Nelson [nelsoner] and Jiyoung Chang [changjiy] under the guidance of Professor Eikmeier during a 2021 Summer MAP Research Project*
